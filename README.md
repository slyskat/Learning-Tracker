 Key Technical Highlights

This project focused on implementing complex client-side architecture without relying on a dedicated backend server.

| Technical Feature | Implementation |

| **State Management** | Centralized application state using **React Context API** to eliminate prop drilling and ensure predictable data flow across all components. |
| **Data Persistence** | **localStorage** was implemented to provide client-side data persistence, ensuring all task history and progress metrics are retained across page refreshes. |
| **Data Visualization** | Integrated the **Recharts** library to render dynamic, color-coded **Pie Charts** based on custom logic calculating task completion percentages in real-time. |
| **Code Quality** | Designed with component reusability and maintainability as a primary goal. |
